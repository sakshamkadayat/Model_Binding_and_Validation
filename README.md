Model Binding and Validation in ASP.NET Core


Model validation in ASP.NET refers to the process of ensuring that the data entered by users through a web form or any other input mechanism adheres to certain rules and constraints before being processed. It helps prevent invalid or malicious data from being saved or processed, maintaining the integrity of the application.

Binding in ASP.NET refers to the process of connecting the data entered by users to the corresponding model or data structure in the application. This allows the application to work with the user's data seamlessly.

In short:

Model Validation: Ensuring data adheres to rules.
Binding: Connecting user data to the application's model.
